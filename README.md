## üîß Modding BarkEngine10 (Lua Support!)

You can now write **mods using Lua!** That‚Äôs right ‚Äì no more DML (Dave Mod Loader was the original way of making mods, but it has now been depecated in return for built in lua mod support!), just zip up a Lua file (and a info.json) and go wild.

### üß± Mod Structure

Each mod is a `.zip` file with these essential files:

*   `info.json`:  Required metadata about your mod (name, author, BarkEngine version).
*   `mod.lua`: Your Lua code that runs when BarkEngine loads the mod.

**Example `info.json`:**

```json
{
  "mod name": "Cool Bark Mod",
  "mod author": "You!",
  "BarkEngine version": "0.1-alpha"
}
```

**Example `mod.lua`:**

```lua
print_debug("Mod loaded!")
alert("Bark!", "Hello from Lua!")
open_window("Lua made this window")
```

Simply put your `.zip` into the `mods/` folder, and BarkEngine10 will load and execute `mod.lua`.

üß† **Lua Modding API**

Your Lua mods can call these functions:

| Function          | Description                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `open_window(title)` | Opens a new UI window with a title         |
| `alert(title, message)` | Shows a message box popup                |
| `print_debug(msg)`   | Prints debug info to the console          |
| `get_mod_name()`    | Returns the current mod‚Äôs name            |
| `ask_file()`       | Opens a file picker (returns path)        |
| `save_file(text)`  | Opens a save dialog and saves text         |

*More Lua functions and integrations will come in future versions ‚Äì like custom UI, game objects, and inter-mod communication!*

‚ú® **Creating Mods with the Mod Maker**

The easiest way to create a new mod is using the built-in Mod Maker:

1.  Click "Open Mod Maker".
2.  Fill in:
    *   Mod Name
    *   Author
    *   Target BarkEngine Version
3.  Optionally, add up to 10 files (images, sounds, scripts, etc.).
4.  Click "Build Mod" ‚Äì it creates a `.zip` mod and places it in the `mods/` folder!

üì¶ **Where to Find Mods**

*   A few sample mods are already in the `mods/` folder of this repository.
*   The code for the BarkEngine Modhub is included (in early alpha). Feel free to mess with it or build your own version.
